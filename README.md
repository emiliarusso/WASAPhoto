# WASA Homework Enroll

This repository contains the source code for the website where Web and Software Application (WASA) students can enroll
for their homework.
The application is collecting students information (student ID, name, repository URL) and it is providing an SSH key
that the student should configure in their repository.

The source is structured as shown in [Fantastic Coffee (decaffeinated) template](https://gitlab.com/sapienzaapps/fantastic-coffee-decaffeinated).

Note: this repository contains some files that are not covered in the WASA course (like the `Makefile`) nor explained in
"Fantastic Coffee (decaffeinated)".
These files are needed for projects hosted in SapienzaApps systems. If you are a WASA student, you can safely ignore
them.
